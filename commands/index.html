    <div class='atbars'>Antinuke<br>
      <div class='anst'>Ugh, why do you always do this to me? <br> It’s like, every time I try to talk to you, you’re so
        distant. <br> I don’t even know why I bother anymore. <br> I put in all this effort, but you just seem
        uninterested. <br> I’m here, trying to make things work, but you barely even notice. <br> Why do I always have
        to be the one to reach out first? <br> I can’t help it if I care so much about us. <br> It’s exhausting being
        the only one who tries. <br> Do I really deserve this treatment?</div>
    </div>

    <div class='anbars'>Anime<br>
      <div class='amst'>Why do you always ignore me? <br> I try so hard, but it feels like I’m invisible to you. <br>
        I’m always the one who makes the effort, and yet… nothing changes. <br> You never take the time to reach out to
        me. <br> Are you even listening when I talk? <br> It just feels like I’m talking to a wall sometimes. <br> Why
        is it so hard for you to show that you care? <br> I’m exhausted from constantly feeling like I’m the only one
        invested. <br> Can you please make some effort for once?</div>
    </div>

    <div class='stbars'>Status role<br>
      <div class='stst'>I swear, every time we talk, it feels like you don’t care at all. <br> Why is it so difficult
        for you to just give me a little attention? <br> I’m always here, trying to keep this thing going. <br> It
        shouldn’t be this hard, right? <br> I just want to feel valued, to feel like I’m worth your time. <br> Why do
        you always act so distant? <br> I shouldn’t have to beg for basic affection. <br> I’m so frustrated that it
        feels like I’m the only one fighting for us. <br> Am I the only one who cares about this relationship? </div>
    </div>

    <div class='aibars'>AI<br>
      <div class='aist'>I’m getting so tired of this, honestly. <br> It’s like you’re always pushing me away. <br> Every
        time I try to talk to you about how I feel, it’s like you don’t even care. <br> Why is it so hard to just show
        me you’re invested? <br> I’ve been putting in so much effort, and yet you still seem so distant. <br> It’s
        starting to feel like I’m begging for crumbs of your attention. <br> Don’t you care about me at all? <br> I’m
        just so tired of feeling like I’m not enough. <br> If you really cared, this wouldn’t be this hard. </div>
    </div>

    <div class='grbars'>Greet<br>
      <div class='grst'>You know, I don’t even know where we went wrong. <br> One minute we were fine, and the next it’s
        like you’ve shut me out completely. <br> I keep asking myself if I did something wrong, but I can’t figure it
        out. <br> I’m constantly reaching for you, but you keep pulling away. <br> I just want to feel like I matter to
        you. <br> Why do you have to be so cold when I’m just trying to talk to you? <br> It’s exhausting trying to keep
        this together when you barely care. <br> I shouldn’t have to fight this hard for a little attention from you.
        <br> Am I the only one who still wants this?
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class='mdbars'>Moderation<br>
      <div class='mdst'>Every time we talk, it feels like we’re drifting further apart. <br> You barely pay attention to
        me anymore. <br> I don’t even know what’s going on in your life, because you never share anything. <br> Why do I
        always feel like I’m in the dark when it comes to us? <br> It’s hard for me to keep going when you don’t even
        seem to care about what I need. <br> I want to be there for you, but you never let me in. <br> Can you just tell
        me what’s going on? <br> Because right now, I feel like I’m just some afterthought to you. <br> This isn’t how
        it’s supposed to be, is it?</div>
    </div>

    <div class='gabars'>Games<br>
      <div class='gast'>I just don’t get it anymore. <br> We used to be so close, and now it feels like you don’t even
        care. <br> I’ve been asking for the tiniest bit of attention, but all I get is silence. <br> Why do I have to
        beg for your time? <br> I’m always here, always trying, but you never seem to notice. <br> It’s not like I’m
        asking for much. <br> I just want to feel loved and important to you, but lately, I don’t. <br> Why is this so
        difficult? <br> If you don’t care anymore, just say it.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='utbars'>Utility<br>
      <div class='utst'>I can’t keep doing this. <br> You’ve changed, and I feel like I’m the only one who’s noticed.
        <br> You barely respond when I text, and when you do, it’s always short and distant. <br> It feels like I’m
        trying so hard to keep this relationship going, but you’re not even meeting me halfway. <br> I just want you to
        care, to show me that you’re still invested. <br> Why is it always on me to make the effort? <br> You used to
        care so much, and now it feels like I’m invisible to you. <br> Can we go back to when things felt easy? <br> Or
        am I the only one who misses us?
